## AMOS Meetings

Here are all the meetings of AMOS-Team-5 listed. A protocol will only be written for SCRUM Team Meetings (Wednesday, 12.30 - 14.00) and for Meetings with our Industry Partner. Our Scrum Master takes care of writing these protocols.

- Add new line to the table
- Add number column
- Add date column
- Add type column (SD|PO|Orga)
- Add Description column
- Add attendees of the meeting and cross out names who were not present
