- The strength search functionality we demoed looks great! 
- The plan for the 6 weeks left also looks good!
- The feature that the UID would change could be neglected. 
- Find an appropriate threshold value of RSSI.
- GPS functionality
  - Used to remember the last location of the device so that the users know where to find if they lost the device.
  - Background service is not the top priority.
  - Background service solution is complicated on iOS. 
- UI test, the View Models should also be covered in unittest.
- Prioritization of Tasks as done by POs was confirmed by Markus.
