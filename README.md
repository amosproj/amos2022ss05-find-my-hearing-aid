We are enrolled at FAU Erlangen-Nuremberg in Germany 🇩🇪 and study computer science or business informatics 👨🏼‍💻👩🏻‍💻. As part of the lecture, we cooperate with an **industry partner** to receive **real business requirements** that we implement into **`CODE`**.   |

> **Note:** The project is currently **ongoing** and will be completed in **early August 2022**. 




### 💭 Our Vision is ...
... to make the life of our customers more convenient by allowing users to locate their important bluetooth devices at any time. This not only saves our users´ time, it also allows them to spend more energy and nerves on things that really count. Because loosing important devices that are indispensable in daily life sucks!

### 🎯 Our Mission is ...
... to create an app for our industry partner by providing the feature of locating BLE devices. The app should be able to detect BLE devices and assign labels to it. In addition it helps tracking the device and navigating to the exact location of the device no matter if in short or long distance. This ensures an overview of all relevant devices at all times.
